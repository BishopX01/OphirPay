# Security Policy

OphirPay takes the security of its users, funds, and infrastructure seriously.
This policy explains how to report a vulnerability, what to expect after you
report, what is in scope, and the safe-harbor protections for researchers who
follow it.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in OphirPay, **do not** open a public
issue, public pull request, discussion, or social post with sensitive details.

Please report it through one of the channels below.

### How to report

1. **GitHub private vulnerability reporting (preferred)**
   On the [Security tab](https://github.com/OphirPay/OphirPay/security/advisories),
   choose **"Report a vulnerability"**. This opens a private advisory that is
   visible only to the repository maintainers.

   > The button only appears while **Private vulnerability reporting** is
   > enabled under *Settings → Code security*. Maintainers: keeping it enabled
   > is what makes this policy work — see the
   > [maintainer checklist](#maintainer-checklist-keeping-the-channel-working).
   > If the button is missing, use option 2: a maintainer can open the private
   > advisory for you (and should re-enable the setting).

2. **No-details issue, then a private advisory (always available)**
   Open a public issue with the
   [Security Vulnerability template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/security_vulnerability.yml)
   that contains **no** exploit details — just the affected component and rough
   severity. Ask a maintainer to open a private advisory with you, then send
   the sensitive details there. This is the fallback that cannot dead-end, and
   it is how issue #1280 was resolved.

> **Email is not a supported channel right now.** The previously documented
> `security@ophirpay.com` address has no MX record, so mail to it bounces
> (issue #1280); `security@ophirpay.dev` does not resolve yet either. Please do
> not send reports to either address. Once a monitored mailbox exists this
> section — and `.well-known/security.txt` — will be updated to list it.

3. **PGP-encrypted email (available once a mailbox is provisioned)**
   When the mailbox above is published, encrypt the full report with the
   security team's public key before sending it, and verify the fingerprint
   over an out-of-band channel (for example the project's
   [SUPPORT.md](.github/SUPPORT.md) or the GitHub organization profile) before
   use. No key or mailbox is published today, so reports must use options 1–2.

> Never send secrets, private keys, or real user data in a report. Redact
> sensitive material and describe it in placeholders instead.

### Maintainer checklist (keeping the channel working)

A disclosure policy that points at a dead channel is worse than no policy, so
maintainers must keep these true:

- [ ] **Settings → Code security → Private vulnerability reporting** is enabled,
      so the "Report a vulnerability" button is visible to researchers.
- [ ] The [Security tab](https://github.com/OphirPay/OphirPay/security/advisories)
      is monitored and new advisories are acknowledged within 48 hours.
- [ ] When a mailbox is provisioned, add it to this file, to
      `.well-known/security.txt` and to `src/lib/security-txt.ts` in the same PR
      (the tests in `src/__tests__/security-txt.test.ts` enforce that the served
      document and the repository file agree).
- [ ] Never advertise an address on a domain without MX records; verify
      deliverability before documenting it.

### What to include in your report

The more complete the report, the faster we can triage it:

- A concise summary of the vulnerability
- Affected component and file paths (e.g. `contracts/ophirpay/src/lib.rs`,
  `src/app/api/**/route.ts`)
- Version, release tag, or commit hash where the issue reproduces
- Environment details: network (TESTNET / PUBLIC), chain/network ID, browser
  and version, OS
- Step-by-step reproduction instructions
- Expected behavior vs. observed behavior
- Security impact: what an attacker can do, and the likely blast radius
- Any logs, screenshots, transaction hashes, addresses, or calldata needed to
  reproduce
- For smart contract issues: contract name, on-chain address, and the
  function(s) involved
- A suggested mitigation, if you have one

### Response expectations

| Stage | Timeframe |
|---|---|
| Acknowledgement of your report | Within **48 hours** |
| Initial triage and severity assessment | Within **5 business days** |
| Fix target — Critical / High | As soon as possible, coordinated with you |
| Fix target — Medium / Low | Next planned release, coordinated with you |
| Advisory publication | After the fix ships, credited to you (if you consent) |

If you do not hear back within the acknowledgement window, follow up on the
same advisory thread. If a channel itself is broken, say so in a public issue
**without sensitive details** and a maintainer will open a private advisory
with you (this is how issue #1280 was resolved).

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are backported to supported release lines:

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Active (current — incl. `v1.0.0-rc1` release candidates) |
| 0.1.x   | ⚠️ Security patches only |

Only the latest release of each supported line receives security fixes.
Older versions are not patched; please upgrade. When reporting, state which
version you found the issue in and whether it reproduces on the latest
release.

## Scope

### In scope

- **Smart contracts**: `contracts/ophirpay/src/lib.rs`,
  `contracts/emitter/src/lib.rs` (and the `contracts/` tree generally)
- **API routes**: `src/app/api/**/route.ts`
- **Authentication**: wallet session auth, API key auth, CSRF handling
- **Webhook system**: URL validation, HMAC signing, SSRF prevention
- **Frontend**: client-side signing flows, wallet integration (Freighter,
  xBull, Rabet, Albedo, Lobstr, Ledger), demo mode
- **Infrastructure**: Dockerfile, Kubernetes manifests, Helm chart, GitHub
  Actions workflows, deployment scripts

### Out of scope

- Third-party services we do not control (Vercel, Neon/PostgreSQL, the Stellar
  network, Horizon/Soroban RPC endpoints)
- Vulnerabilities in upstream dependencies — report them to the dependency's
  maintainers (Dependabot / `npm audit` also surface these)
- Issues that require physical access to a device or social engineering of a
  user
- Known issues already documented in [docs/AUDIT.md](docs/AUDIT.md)
- Best-practice suggestions with no demonstrated vulnerability — please open a
  regular [feature request](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml) instead

If you are unsure whether something is in scope, report it anyway — we prefer
an out-of-scope report to a missed one.

## Safe Harbor

We will not pursue civil or criminal legal action, and will not report you to
law enforcement or your employer, for security research conducted in good
faith that complies with this policy, including:

- Research performed on your own OphirPay deployment, the testnet contracts,
  or the public instance **without** exceeding the limits below
- Testing that does not access, modify, or delete other users' data
- Testing that does not disrupt the availability of the service
- Reporting the vulnerability privately and giving us a reasonable
  opportunity to fix it before any public disclosure
- Not exploiting a vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate it

If legal action is initiated by a third party against you for research that
followed this policy, we will consider making a public statement in your
support.

## Responsible Disclosure Process

### Step 1: Report the Vulnerability

Open a private GitHub advisory (preferred) — or a no-details public issue that
asks a maintainer to open one — with the following information:

- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Brief description of the vulnerability`
- **Body**:
  - Description of the vulnerability
  - Steps to reproduce (include URLs, endpoints, and request/response examples if applicable)
  - Affected versions (check `package.json` or `Cargo.toml`)
  - Potential impact (what an attacker could achieve)
  - Any suggested mitigations (if you have them)
  - Your preferred contact method for follow-up questions

### Step 2: Acknowledgment

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **48 hours** via email.

### Step 3: Validation

Our security team will validate the vulnerability within **5 business days**. We may contact you for additional details or clarification.

### Step 4: Resolution

Once validated, we will:
- Develop and test a fix
- Deploy the fix to production
- Publish a security advisory on GitHub
- Credit you in the advisory (unless you prefer anonymity)

### Step 5: Reward

If eligible, you will receive a reward based on the severity of the vulnerability (see Bug Bounty Program below).

## Security.txt

OphirPay publishes a `security.txt` file at `/.well-known/security.txt` following the [RFC 9116](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9116) standard. This file provides security researchers with contact information and disclosure policies.

The file is accessible at:
- **Production**: https://ophirpay.vercel.app/.well-known/security.txt — served by
  `src/app/.well-known/security.txt/route.ts` from `src/lib/security-txt.ts`; a
  test asserts this document and the repository file below stay in sync
- **Repository**: https://github.com/OphirPay/OphirPay/blob/main/.well-known/security.txt

## CSRF Protection Policy

### For Users

- OphirPay never stores private keys — all signing happens client-side via
  Freighter
- Always verify the destination address before signing
- Check transaction details in Freighter before approving
- Use a hardware wallet for production/mainnet operations
- Never share your wallet seed phrase or private keys

### For Developers

- Run `npm audit` regularly to check for dependency vulnerabilities
- Keep all dependencies up to date
- Review PRs for security implications
- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Follow the contract security guidance below for any contract change

1. **Token Generation**: Clients request a CSRF token from `GET /api/csrf`.
   The server generates a cryptographically secure random token (256 bits),
   sets it as an `HttpOnly` cookie, and returns the token in the response body.

2. **Token Storage**: The client stores the token in memory (not localStorage
   or sessionStorage) and sends it as the `x-csrf-token` header on all
   mutating requests.

3. **Token Validation**: On mutating requests, the server compares the
   `x-csrf-token` header against the CSRF cookie value using constant-time
   comparison to prevent timing attacks.

### Rules

1. **Do not** exploit the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate it
2. **Do not** access, modify, or delete other users' data
3. **Do not** disrupt the live service (ophirpay.vercel.app)
4. **Do not** disclose the vulnerability publicly before it is resolved
5. Provide a clear proof-of-concept with steps to reproduce
6. Report vulnerabilities in good faith

- **Production (HTTPS)**: Cookie named `__Host-csrf` with `Secure` attribute
- **Development (HTTP)**: Cookie named `csrf` without `Secure` attribute
  (browsers reject `__Host-` cookies without Secure on non-localhost HTTP)

1. Report via one of the [private channels](#how-to-report) above
2. We acknowledge within 48 hours
3. We validate and determine severity within 5 business days
4. We ship a fix and publish an advisory
5. You receive credit in the advisory + reward (with your consent)

```typescript
// Method 1: Manual enforcement
import { verifyCsrf } from "@/lib/csrf";

OphirPay implements the following security headers
([`next.config.ts`](next.config.ts) is the single source of truth for static headers;
`src/proxy.ts` sets the per-request `Content-Security-Policy` and violation-reporting headers):
- For the CSP directives, nonce flow and maintenance procedure, see
  [Security Headers & Content Security Policy](docs/SECURITY.md).
- For the layer-by-layer effective policy, including Vercel behavior and API
  overrides, see [Security Header Policy](docs/SECURITY_HEADERS.md).
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 0` (the legacy `1; mode=block` filter is deprecated and
  must not be re-enabled)
- `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), payment=()`
- `Content-Security-Policy` — strict `default-src 'self'`, `connect-src`
  limited to Stellar/Soroban endpoints, `frame-src` limited to wallet
  extensions, `object-src 'none'`, `base-uri 'self'`, `form-action 'self'`.

  `script-src` is nonce-based: `'self' 'nonce-<per-request>' 'strict-dynamic'
  'wasm-unsafe-eval'` in production (plus `'unsafe-eval'` in development for
  HMR). `'unsafe-inline'` is **not** present, so injected inline scripts are
  blocked. The proxy sets the CSP on the *request* headers so the App Router
  renderer stamps the nonce on its framework scripts, and forwards it as
  `x-nonce` for the inline scripts in `src/app/layout.tsx`.

  **History (issues #697 → #1257):** earlier builds kept `'unsafe-inline'`
  because the nonce appeared not to reach the renderer. Re-tested on
  next@16.3.4 (2026-09-30): the cause was the proxy setting the CSP only on
  the response. With the request header set, framework scripts carry
  `nonce="…"` and pages hydrate with no CSP violations. See `src/proxy.ts`.

- `Report-To` / `Reporting-Endpoints` — browsers POST CSP violation reports
  to `POST /api/csp-report`, which validates, size-limits, and logs them via
  the structured logger (with PII redaction) and counts them in the
  `csp_violation_reports_total` metric (issue #698).

// Method 2: Higher-order function wrapper
import { withCsrf } from "@/lib/csrf";

- All contract functions use proper access control
- Cross-contract calls are validated and propagate failures atomically (see
  `docs/architecture.md` for the system overview)
- Contracts use Result types for error handling
- Timestamps and metadata are recorded for audit trails
- State-changing operations — governance proposal execution, the
  escrow/stream lifecycle (create, release, claim, cancel), refund
  processing, emergency withdraw, and cross-contract pause orchestration —
  are guarded by reentrancy locks
- Sensitive admin actions are protected by two-step ownership transfer (24h
  timelock) and timelocked upgrades
